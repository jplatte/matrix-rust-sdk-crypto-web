# unreleased

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   `OlmMachine.bootstrapCrossSigning` no longer returns an array of request
    objects. Rather, it returns a new class (`CrossSigningBootstrapRequests`)
    which contains the request objects within it.

    As part of this work, `SigningKeysUploadRequest` (which was one of the
    types formerly returned by `bootstrapCrossSigning`) has been renamed to
    `UploadSigningKeysRequest` for consistency with the underlying SDK.

## Other changes

-   Olm decryption operations will no longer log large quantities of data about
    the data `Store`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.0.0

Do not use this release. It has a [critical bug[(https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/2802).

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.2.0

-   Added bindings versions details to `getVersions()`. Two new fields `git_sha` and
    `git_description` have been included in the returned `Versions` struct.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.1.1

## Changes in the underlying Rust crate

-   Clean up the logging of to-device messages in `share_room_key`. Also fixes
    some `panic` errors which were introduced in v2.1.0.

-   Remove spurious "Unknown outgoing secret request" warning which was logged
    for every outgoing secret request.

-   Various other changes.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.1.0

-   Attach message IDs to outgoing to-device messages, and log the IDs on
    incoming messages.

-   Improve logging output to include more information, including data that is
    attached to tracing spans. Remove the `tracing` feature: tracing support is
    now always included.

-   BugFix: `ToDeviceRequest` returned by `shareRoomKey(..)` always had an `undefined` `id` field.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.0.0

-   Updated rust sdk version to revision [c2bb76029ae6d99c741727e0f87abcd734377016](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/c2bb76029ae6d99c741727e0f87abcd734377016), including:
    -   [Remove dashmap crate usage from matrix-sdk-crypto](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2669)
    -   [Bugfix for invalidated private cross signing keys not being persisted](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2676)
-   API Break: `RoomId.localpart` and `RoomId.serverName` have been removed.

    `OlmMachine.getSecretsFromInbox`, `OlmMachine.deleteSecretsFromInbox`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v1.3.0

-   Expose new method `OlmMachine.getRoomEventEncryptionInfo`.
-   Update `IndexeddbCryptoStore` to use a single store for outgoing secret
    requests.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v1.2.2

## Changes in the WASM bindings

-   `OlmMachine.decrypt_room_event()` now throws a
    typed `MegolmDecryptionError` instead of generic `Error`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v1.2.1

## Changes in the WASM bindings

-   Expose `version` field of `KeysBackupRequest`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v1.2.0

## Changes in the WASM bindings

-   The `BackupKeys` structure returned by `OlmMachine.getBackupKeys` now
    contains a `decryptionKey` property which is is a `BackupDecryptionKey`
    instance.

-   Expose `SignatureVerification.trusted` method.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v1.1.0

## Changes in the WASM bindings

-   Expose bindings for secure key backup.
-   Expose `OwnUserIdentity.isVerified`.

## Changes in the underlying Rust crate

-   Mark our `OwnUserIdentity` as verified if we successfully import the matching private keys.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v1.0.1

No functional changes. Fixes for the release process which prevented v1.0.0
being released.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v1.0.0

Project renamed to `matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm`. No functional changes.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-js v0.1.4

    request.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-js v0.1.3

## Changes in the Javascript bindings

-   Fix bug introduced in v0.1.2 which caused an undocumented change to the results of `OlmMachine.receiveSyncChanges`.

## Changes in the underlying Rust crate

-   Fix a bug which could cause generated one-time-keys not to be persisted.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-js v0.1.2

**WARNING**: this version had a breaking change in the result type of `OlmMachine.receiveSyncChanges`.
This is corrected in v0.1.3.

## Changes in the Javascript bindings

-   Add `Qr.state()` method to inspect the current state of QR code
    verifications.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-js v0.1.0

## Changes in the Javascript bindings

-   In `OlmMachine.getIdentity`, wait a limited time for any in-flight
    device-list updates to complete.

-   Add `VerificationRequest.timeRemainingMillis()`.

## Changes in the underlying Rust crate

-   When rejecting a key-verification request over to-device messages, send the
    `m.key.verification.cancel` to the device that made the request, rather
    than broadcasting to all devices.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-js v0.1.0-alpha.11

    SAS verification with the `Sas::accept()` method.
