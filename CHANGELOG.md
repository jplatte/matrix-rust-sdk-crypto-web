# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v4.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   Rename `OlmMachine.init_from_store` introduced in v3.6.0 to
    `OlmMachine.initFromStore`.
    ([#84](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/84))

-   Functions/methods that take a JavaScript `Array` as argument now invalidate the
    items within that array so that they cannot be re-used as soon as
    they are received by the functions/methods. See the patch for affected methods.
    ([#82](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/82/))

**Other changes**

-   Update `wasm-bindgen` to 0.2.89. It allows to remove the `downcast` method.
    It fixes [#51](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/51),
    thus the resulting JavaScript code of `matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm` can
    be minified with no issue now.
    ([#82](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/82/))

-   Report failures to callback when importing backed-up room keys. The
    `progress_listener` callback in the `OlmMachine.importBackedUpRoomKeys`
    function is now called with a third argument, giving the number of invalid
    room keys.
    ([#85](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/85))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.6.0

    crypto store, and thus improve performance when doing multiple operations
    on the store.
    ([#76](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/76))

-   Update `matrix-rust-sdk` version, with changes including:
    -   Fix for an issue which caused the same keys to be repeatedly backed up.
        ([matrix-rust-sdk#2937](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2957))
    -   Performance improvement in `markRequestAsSent`.
        ([matrix-rust-sdk#2977](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2977))
    -   Logging for the open sequence for indexeddb store.
        ([matrix-rust-sdk#2983](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2983))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.5.0

-   New API `OlmMachine.requestMissingSecretsIfNeeded` that creates an
    outgoing secret request to other sessions.

-   Verification cancel codes for `cancelWithCode` and `cancelInfo.cancelCode`
    are now passed as strings rather than an enum.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.4.0

-   Include Rust symbol names in the generated wasm output.
    ([#65](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/65))

-   Add new properties `roomKeyRequestsEnabled` and `roomKeyForwardingEnabled`
    to OlmMachine.

    ([matrix-rust-sdk#2902](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2902))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.2.0

-   Add `timeout_secs` parameters to `OlmMachine.get_user_devices` and
    `OlmMachine.get_device`. ([#60](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/60))

-   Improve efficiency of IndexedDB storage of `inbound_group_sessions`.
    ([matrix-rust-sdk#2885](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2885))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.1.0

-   Improve performance of `OlmMachine.shareRoomKey`.
    ([matrix-rust-sdk#2862](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2862))

    requests on blacklisted servers, and improve performance.
    ([matrix-rust-sdk#2845](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2845))

-   Various clarifications to the log messages written during encryption operations.
    ([matrix-rust-sdk#2859](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2859))

-   `OlmMachine.importRoomKeys` is now deprecated in favour of separate
    methods for importing room keys from backup and export,
    `OlmMachine.importBackedUpRoomKeys` and
    `OlmMachine.importExportedRoomKeys`.

-   Minor improvements to the formatting of messages logged to the console.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.0.1

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   `OlmMachine.bootstrapCrossSigning` no longer returns an array of request
    objects. Rather, it returns a new class (`CrossSigningBootstrapRequests`)
    which contains the request objects within it.

    As part of this work, `SigningKeysUploadRequest` (which was one of the
    types formerly returned by `bootstrapCrossSigning`) has been renamed to
    `UploadSigningKeysRequest` for consistency with the underlying SDK.

## Other changes

-   Devices which have exhausted their one-time-keys will now be correctly
    handled in `/keys/claim` responses (we will register them as "failed" and
    stop attempting to send to them for a while.)

-   Olm decryption operations will no longer log large quantities of data about
    the data `Store`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.0.0

Do not use this release. It has a [critical bug](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/2802).

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.2.0

-   Added bindings versions details to `getVersions()`. Two new fields `git_sha` and
    `git_description` have been included in the returned `Versions` struct.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.1.1

## Changes in the underlying Rust crate

-   Clean up the logging of to-device messages in `share_room_key`. Also fixes
    some `panic` errors which were introduced in v2.1.0.

-   Remove spurious "Unknown outgoing secret request" warning which was logged
    for every outgoing secret request.

-   Various other changes.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.1.0

-   Attach message IDs to outgoing to-device messages, and log the IDs on
    incoming messages.

-   Improve logging output to include more information, including data that is
    attached to tracing spans. Remove the `tracing` feature: tracing support is
    now always included.

-   BugFix: `ToDeviceRequest` returned by `shareRoomKey(..)` always had an `undefined` `id` field.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.0.0

-   Updated rust sdk version to revision [c2bb76029ae6d99c741727e0f87abcd734377016](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/c2bb76029ae6d99c741727e0f87abcd734377016), including:
    -   [Remove dashmap crate usage from matrix-sdk-crypto](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2669)
    -   [Bugfix for invalidated private cross signing keys not being persisted](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2676)
