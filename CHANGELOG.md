# UNRELEASED

-   Add a `StoreHandle` class which can be used to hold a connection to a
    crypto store, and thus improve performance when doing multiple operations
    on the store.

    ([matrix-rust-sdk#2859](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2859))

    methods for importing room keys from backup and export,
    `OlmMachine.importBackedUpRoomKeys` and
    `OlmMachine.importExportedRoomKeys`.

-   Minor improvements to the formatting of messages logged to the console.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.0.1

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   `OlmMachine.bootstrapCrossSigning` no longer returns an array of request
    objects. Rather, it returns a new class (`CrossSigningBootstrapRequests`)
    which contains the request objects within it.

    As part of this work, `SigningKeysUploadRequest` (which was one of the
    types formerly returned by `bootstrapCrossSigning`) has been renamed to
    `UploadSigningKeysRequest` for consistency with the underlying SDK.

## Other changes

-   Devices which have exhausted their one-time-keys will now be correctly
    handled in `/keys/claim` responses (we will register them as "failed" and
    stop attempting to send to them for a while.)

-   Olm decryption operations will no longer log large quantities of data about
    the data `Store`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.0.0

Do not use this release. It has a [critical bug](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/2802).

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.2.0

-   Added bindings versions details to `getVersions()`. Two new fields `git_sha` and
    `git_description` have been included in the returned `Versions` struct.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.1.1

## Changes in the underlying Rust crate

-   Clean up the logging of to-device messages in `share_room_key`. Also fixes
    some `panic` errors which were introduced in v2.1.0.

-   Remove spurious "Unknown outgoing secret request" warning which was logged
    for every outgoing secret request.

-   Various other changes.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.1.0

-   Attach message IDs to outgoing to-device messages, and log the IDs on
    incoming messages.

-   Improve logging output to include more information, including data that is
    attached to tracing spans. Remove the `tracing` feature: tracing support is
    now always included.

-   BugFix: `ToDeviceRequest` returned by `shareRoomKey(..)` always had an `undefined` `id` field.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.0.0

-   Updated rust sdk version to revision [c2bb76029ae6d99c741727e0f87abcd734377016](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/c2bb76029ae6d99c741727e0f87abcd734377016), including:
